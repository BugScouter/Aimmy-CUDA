## What is the purpose of Aimmy?
### Aimmy was designed for Gamers who are at a severe disadvantage over normal gamers.
### This includes but is not limited to:
- Gamers who are physically challenged
- Gamers who are mentally challenged
- Gamers who suffer from untreated/untreatable visual impairments
- Gamers who do not have access to a seperate Human-Interface Device (HID) for controlling the pointer
- Gamers trying to improve their reaction time
- Gamers with poor Hand/Eye coordination

## How does Aimmy Work?
Aimmy works by using AI Image Recognition to detect opponents, pointing the player towards the direction of an opponent accordingly. 

The gamer is now left to perform any actions they believe is necessary.

Additionally, a Gamer that uses Aimmy is also given the option to turn on Auto-Trigger. Auto-Trigger relieves the need to repeatedly tap the HID to shoot at a player. This is especially useful for physically challenged users who may have trouble with this action.
